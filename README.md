This repository outputs an .SVG file of an Idealised Wind Turbine Power Curve diagram.

This was created due to the lack of a wind turbine power curve in .SVG format on Wikimedia Commons, and also due to none being released under Public Domain ([CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)

## Idealised Wind Turbine Power Curve
For a specific turbine model, wind turbine manufacturers provide a dataset of rated power output (watts/kilowatts/megawatts) vs. wind-speed (m/s)
. These datasets typically follow the general shape of the .SVG provided in [img/Idealised Wind Turbine Power Curve.svg](img/Idealised%20Wind%20Turbine%20Power%20Curve.svg). 

"Wind speed" refers to an undisturbed wind velocity measured at a suitable distance upstream from the blades. [[1], p.7]

"Wind turbine" here refers to the entire energy conversion system, which converts kinetic energy in wind to electrical energy.

The **cut-in wind speed** is the wind speed at which the turbine begins producing power. The **rated power** is the maximum power the turbine may output. The **rated wind speed** is where the turbine first outputs its rated power, and the **cut-out wind speed** is where this output power instantaneously drops from the rated power to zero watts.

### Diagram values

The values chosen for the power and each wind speed can be modified at the top of [main.py](main.py).

The chosen values and the shape of the curve between cut-in and rated wind speed are not specific to any turbine model, or size of the turbine model. In reality, these would be specific to a model.

### Caveats
* This diagram assumes that the power generated is limited to the rated power between the rated and cut-out wind speeds, which is typical.
* The Idealised Wind Turbine Power Curve "assumes a smooth laminar flow of a high degree of homogeneity and symmetry" [[1], p.7]. Methods exist to predict real world performance, such as by using the idealised power curve in conjunction with a Power Deviation Matrix which gives _percentage power deviations_ from the idealised power curve against _Turbulence Intensity_ and _Normalised Wind Speed_, a method devised by the [Power Curve Working Group](https://pcwg.org/) [[2]]; ideally, this would be provided by turbine manufacturers in addition to a power curve.

## Running the code
While the .SVG is provided under [img](img), it can be re-generated by:

1. Ensuring a compatible version of Python is installed on your computer, with the range of suitable versions defined in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
2. Installing [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/); run the provided code in your computer terminal
3. Set up a Poetry environment for the project, installing the requirements in `pyproject.toml`.
4. Run [main.py](main.py), e.g.: `poetry shell`, then `python main.py`

Alternatively, you can convert the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) to a `requirements.txt`-type file and use it with Python's pip, ideally within a Python virtual environment.
